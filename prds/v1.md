Below is a detailed PRD broken down into actionable tasks. You can copy and paste it into an agentic editor like Cursor. This project will be a Cargo workspace with three crates:

- **tap-didcomm-core** – handles message packing/unpacking with full async signing, encryption, and verification using the `ssi` crate (and its dependencies). It exposes a plugin mechanism to allow custom DID resolvers, signers, encryptors, etc.
- **tap-didcomm-node** – builds on tap-didcomm-core to create an abstract DIDComm node. It will have a `receive()` function for incoming messages, implement an Actix Actor interface (so actors can subscribe to messages), and include a `dispatch()` function for sending messages (abstracted to use `reqwest` on native Rust and `fetch` for WASM).
- **tap-didcomm-web** – an HTTP server (using Actix-web) that wraps a tap-didcomm-node instance. Storage is out of scope, but an example logging actor will be implemented.

The project will only support DIDComm v2. It should use the `ssi` crate for encryption, decryption, JWS, and DID resolver support, follow best practices for Rust testing, and be set up for CI using GitHub Actions. The entire project will be MIT licensed.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Build a simple, modular DIDComm v2 library in Rust that can run both natively and in WASM environments. The library will be organized as a workspace with multiple crates and will leverage the `ssi` crate for cryptographic and DID functionality.

- **Key Features:**
  - Async message packing/unpacking with support for signing, encryption, and verification.
  - Pluggable DID resolvers, signers, encryptors, decryptors, etc.
  - An abstract DIDComm node with Actix Actor support for receiving and dispatching messages.
  - A web layer (via Actix-web) that exposes HTTP endpoints wrapping a DIDComm node.
  - Only support DIDComm v2.
  - Use the `ssi` crate for crypto (encryption, decryption, JWS) and DID resolution.
  - A sample logging actor to demonstrate message handling.
  - Best practices for Rust testing and CI/CD via GitHub Actions.
  - MIT licensed.

## Technical Requirements

- **DIDComm v2 only:**  
  The implementation will strictly follow the DIDComm v2 spec.
  
- **Dependencies:**  
  Use the `ssi` crate (and its dependencies) for all crypto, signing, encryption, decryption, JWS, and DID resolver functionalities.

- **Cross-Platform:**  
  The design should work natively and be compatible with WebAssembly (WASM). The dispatch mechanism should use `reqwest` for native Rust and use a WASM-friendly HTTP client (wrapping `fetch`) when compiled to WASM.

- **Testing & CI:**  
  Follow Rust testing best practices (unit, integration tests) and set up GitHub Actions to run tests, linting (clippy), and formatting checks.

- **Licensing:**  
  The entire project will be MIT licensed.

  - Create a new Rust crate named `tap-didcomm-core`.
  
- [x] **Message Definitions:**  
  - Define data structures representing DIDComm v2 messages.
  - Include type definitions and enums for various DIDComm v2 components (headers, bodies, attachments, etc.).

- [x] **Core Functionality Implementation:**  
  - **Packing & Encryption:**  
    - Implement asynchronous message packing that supports encryption and signing.
    - Use the `ssi` crate for encryption, JWS creation, and signing.
  - **Unpacking & Decryption:**  
    - Implement asynchronous message unpacking that supports decryption and verification.
    - Use the `ssi` crate for decryption, JWS verification, and DID resolution.
  
- [x] **Plugin Architecture:**  
  - Define traits/interfaces for pluggable DID resolvers, signers, encryptors, decryptors, etc.
  - Provide a mechanism to register and swap these plugins dynamically.

- [x] **Unit Testing & Documentation:**  
  - Write comprehensive unit tests for message packing, unpacking, signing, and encryption.
  - Generate documentation (using Rustdoc) for the public API.

### tap-didcomm-node Crate

- [x] **Crate Initialization:**  
  - Create a new Rust crate named `tap-didcomm-node`.

- [x] **DIDComm Node Core:**  
  - Define a DIDComm node struct that wraps a tap-didcomm-core instance.
  - Implement a `receive()` function to handle incoming DIDComm v2 messages asynchronously.
  - Implement a `dispatch()` function for sending messages out.  
    - Abstract the network call to use `reqwest` for native Rust.
    - Provide a WASM abstraction that uses `fetch` (this might be conditional based on compile-time features).

- [x] **Actix Actor Integration:**  
  - Integrate the Actix Actor framework:
    - Create an actor that can subscribe to and process incoming messages.
    - Implement the necessary Actor traits and message handlers.
  
- [x] **Example Logging Actor:**  
  - Implement an example logging actor that simply logs any incoming DIDComm messages.

- [x] **Unit & Integration Testing:**  
  - Write tests for the node's `receive()` and `dispatch()` functions.

    - Receiving DIDComm messages (e.g. POST endpoint).
    - Dispatching DIDComm messages (internal endpoint or API to send messages).
  
- [x] **Integration with tap-didcomm-node:**  
  - Integrate the tap-didcomm-node instance so that the HTTP server can invoke its `receive()` and `dispatch()` functions.

    - Checkout the code.
    - Set up the Rust toolchain.
    - Run `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo fmt -- --check`.
    - Optionally, run tests in both native and WASM (if feasible) targets.
