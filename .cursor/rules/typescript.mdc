description: Rules for writing good typescript
globs: *.ts
---
- Always write idiomatic Typescript code.
- Prefer using interfaces and enums over types
- Prefer using pnpm as the package manager
- Every new function or module must include comprehensive unit tests using vitest
- Use Typescript's error handling best practices (Result<T, E>, ? operator, etc.).
- Document all public APIs with comprehensive typedoc comments.
- Remember that any WASM code needs to be compiled from the Rust code in the `tap-didcomm-core` and `tap-didcomm-node` packages.
- Always check you are in the correct directory before running any commands.
